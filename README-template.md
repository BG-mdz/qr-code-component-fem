## My process
ðŸ“’â€‹As usual, I start by sketching what I am about to code.
Then, on my html I used 1 main div to contain the card,text and image, and I made use of another div to contain the main content of the card.
By applying the flex property, I could give the card a one dimension view.
I centered the div by using box-sizing.
